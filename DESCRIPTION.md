# Backpropagation Engine

A lightweight, header-only C++ library for automatic differentiation and neural network training. Built with modern C++17, this engine provides an intuitive interface for constructing and training computational graphs through reverse-mode automatic differentiation (backpropagation).

## Key Features
- Clean, template-free implementation using pure C++
- No external dependencies beyond the standard library
- Intuitive matrix operations through the Multi-Linear Map (MLM) class
- Automatic gradient computation and accumulation
- Beautiful visualization of computational graphs
- Comprehensive test suite and examples

## Design Philosophy
The engine prioritizes readability and educational value over raw performance, making it ideal for:
- Learning about automatic differentiation
- Prototyping neural network architectures
- Understanding backpropagation mechanics
- Teaching neural network concepts

While not designed for production use, the clean architecture makes it an excellent starting point for more specialized implementations.
